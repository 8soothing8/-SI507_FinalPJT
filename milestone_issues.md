1. Requesting and caching data from Youtube API
2. Building codes that can find necessary information from a cached file
3. Connecting the codes with pages
4. Setting up user interface for a user

# Issues

- I haven't tried getting data via Youtube API yet, so there can be an issue when I actually try. (related to milestone 1)

- Youtube data would have a different data structure from what I got used so that I should navigate in the data for a while. (related to milestone 2)

- Creating classes and inheriting (making relations among classes) would be complex. (related to milestone 2)

- I can't think of the way to filter the data by date and get other information on the specific day. I might need to make another object that has only information about a certain date. (related to milestone 4)

-  I'm not sure if I can broaden the period of search with some text data manipulation. I would try to make this application allow a user to search for a certain month. (related to milestone 2)

- I don't know how to make dropdown menus for date selection. There should be three separate dropdown menus for Year, Month, Day information and the routes should be able to aggregate those three numbers to search for a specific date. (related to milestone 4)

- Templating Flask application would be more complicated than I expected. (related to milestone 4)

- which data visualization tools or methods that I need to use to make the information easily understandable. (related to milestone 4)
